"# Marple_thesis" 

Marple is a run time path visualizer tool that I am working on as a part of my thesis for my Computer Science (MSc) studies at [ELTE](https://www.elte.hu/en/faculties/informatics).

Marple can visualize with nice directed graphs the path of execution of a program written in theory any language that satisfy on some level the procedural paradigm (it has functions or subroutines).
Currently supported languages:
* C
* C++
* Python

If your language is not present on the list then you will need to write a language support extension but I will give you help for this further down.
